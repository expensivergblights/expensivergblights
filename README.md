# About Me
Hello, graphic design is my passion... no, actually  
Some of my other interests include:  
  - distro hopping,  
  - customising rices,  
  - and web design.  
    
I'm currently working on multiple useful applications, which are all distributed  
as AppImages meaning they can be used on Windows, MacOS and most Linux distros.  
Right now I'm busy wasting my time and can't spare any writing out this readme, so I'll leave it there. Cya :)
