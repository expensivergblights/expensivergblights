# About Me
Hello, graphic design is my passion... no, actually  
Some of my other interests include:  
  - distro hopping,  
  - customising rices,  
  - and web design.  
    
I'm currently working on multiple useful applications, which are all distributed  
as .exe meaning they can be used on Windows, however a lot also have AppImages.
Right now I'm busy wasting my time and can't spare any writing out this readme, so I'll leave it there. Cya :)
